/**
 * Facilitates the rendering of "scale-9" images, that is, images that are designed as a 3x3 grid
 * such that each of the 9 pieces is fixed or stretched in one or both directions to fit a
 * designated area. The corners are drawn without scaling, the top and bottom center pieces are
 * scaled horizontally, the left and right center pieces are scaled vertically, and the center
 * piece is scaled both horizontally and vertically.
 * <p>By default, the cells are assumed to be of equal size (hence scale-9 image dimensions are
 * normally a multiple of 3). By using {@link #xaxis} and {@link #yaxis}, this partitioning can be
 * controlled directly. For example, if the horizontal middle of an image is a single pixel, this
 * code will do that and automatically grow the left and right edges if necessary:
 * <pre><code>
 *     Scale9 s9 = ...;
 *     s9.xaxis.resize(1, 1);
 * </code></pre></p>
 * <p>NOTE: Asynchronous loading of images is not supported. The caller must preload images or
 * the behavior is undefined.</p>
